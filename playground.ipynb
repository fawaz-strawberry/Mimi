Ultra-violet light or ordinary sunlight shining upon certain chemicals will make them emit a glow usually of longer wave-length than the light they have absorbed. Similarly, the gases of a comet absorb light from the sun and then emit it agciin. For example, a carbon molecule in a comet absorbs a blue ray from sunlight and then emits the same blue ray into space.

Their development has paralleled your own in some respects, in others it has differed. They belong to us now, by their own wish.

He tripped me and broke my back!\" Penelope was putting on a good act too, crying and wringing her hands and moaning. \"My poor boy!\" she said, over and over. A woman in the crowd came up and made a very expressive raspberry in the little man's face. The little man was not only bewildered; he was frightened.
